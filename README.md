# Custom Design Manager for STAR-CCM+ FSAE Style CFD Simulations

## Justifications

- StarCCM's built in Design mangager is difficult to setup and unreliable
- This allows us to better suit our avaliable HPC resources
- Allows for much better error handling and logging
- Can use whatever DOE method works best for us
